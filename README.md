<h1>Rice Leaf Disease Detection</h1>
This project focuses on the detection and classification of three major diseases affecting rice leaves: Leaf Smut, Brown Spot, and Bacterial Leaf Blight. The tasks involve comprehensive data analysis, model development, and evaluation, along with reporting the challenges faced and the techniques used.

## Project Structure

### Task 1: Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Prepare a detailed data analysis report on the given dataset.
- **Description:** This section covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insights derived from the dataset. It aims to understand the distribution of diseases and the characteristics of the images.

### Task 2: Model Development
- **Objective:** Create a machine learning model to classify the three types of rice leaf diseases.
- **Description:** Multiple models are developed and compared, including CNNs and other relevant architectures. The best-performing model is recommended for production use.

### Task 3: Techniques Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze techniques like Data Augmentation and create a report.
- **Description:** This section explores various preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance, with a detailed report on the impact of each technique.

### Model Comparison Report
- **Description:** A comparative analysis of different models, discussing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The report includes suggestions on the most suitable model for deployment.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Description:** A report outlining the challenges encountered during the project, such as data imbalance or model overfitting, and the strategies employed to overcome them.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 120 images of rice leaves affected by different diseases, divided into three classes:
